# Alvik Robot Initialization Script
#
# This script synchronizes a MicroPython device to a desired state by:
# 1. Deleting all files and directories not in a predefined whitelist.
# 2. Copying a list of specified local files and directories to the device.
#
# Usage:
#   ./initialize_robot.sh
#   ./initialize_robot.sh -p /dev/tty.usbmodem1234561 # Specify a port
#   ./initialize_robot.sh -c "id:e6616407e3496e2e" # Specify a device ID
#
# ==============================================================================

set -e # Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.

# --- CONFIGURATION ---

# A whitelist of files and directories to KEEP on the device.
# Any file or directory NOT in this list will be deleted.
# IMPORTANT: All paths MUST start with a leading slash '/'.
# TIP: Add files from your COPY_LIST here if you don't want them
#      to be deleted and re-copied every time.
WHITELIST=(
    "/lib" # Whitelisting a directory keeps it and its contents

# A list of local files and directories to COPY to the device.
# The script will use `cp -r`, so directories are copied recursively.
