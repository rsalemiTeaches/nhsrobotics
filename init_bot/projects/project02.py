# ==========================================================
#                      Control the LEDs                     
#       In this project, you'll use the buttons on the      
#      back of the ALVIK to control the LEDs.  It works     
#                         like this:                        
#                  No button--Two blue LEDs                 
#                  Left--Left LED is green                 
#                  Right--Right LED is green                
#                  Up--Both LEDs are yellow                 
#                  Down--Both LEDs are purple
#                  Cancel--Stop Running

# WORK Import the ArduinoAlvik class and the sleep_ms() function
from arduino_alvik import ArduinoAlvik #get the alvik controller description

# WORK Create a new ArduinoAlvik object named bot

    # WORK: Check to see if the RIGHT ARROW is pushed
    # WORK: If the RIGHT ARROW is pushed set the
    # WORK RIGHT LED to GREEN 


    # WORK: Check to see if the UP ARROW is pushed.
    # WORK: If the UP ARROW is pushed set both 
    # WORK: LEDS to Yellow (RED, GREEN, OFF)


    # WORK: Check to see if the DOWN ARROW is pushed.
    # WORK: If the DOWN ARROW is pushed set both 
    # WORK: LEDS to PURPLE (RED, OFF, BLUE)

    
    # WORK: Sleep for 10 ms

finally:
  # WORK  When you are out of the loop 
  # or there is an interruption
  # turn off both LEDs and stop the robot.
