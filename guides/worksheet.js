// The robotics project worksheet — one sheet per project, filled in by hand and
// shown with the running robot. V01
//
//   node worksheet.js                       -> Robotics_Project_Worksheet.pdf
//   node worksheet.js "Some Other Name.pdf"
//
// This script is the source. The PDF is output and there is no editable copy of
// the sheet anywhere, for the same reason no guide has one: an edit that is not
// here cannot survive the next run. Listed in extras.txt so build-all.sh remakes
// and deploys it with the guides.
//
// It is not built by ../builder — that makes guides, and this is a form: ruled
// write-on lines, checkbox glyphs, and answer space measured in blank lines.
// It borrows the builder's topdf.js to reach a PDF, and the builder's copy of
// the `docx` package rather than keeping a second one -- which is why the
// require below has a fallback.
//
// The wording and the boxes match what the worksheet has always said. The three
// Part B questions are deliberately the same on every project — being able to
// explain your code is how you show it is really yours. The scoring matches
// course.js: work 19, flex 20, late × 0.9, and a redo is 0 until it is complete.
