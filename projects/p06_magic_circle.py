# Project 06: The Magic Circle
# Version: V01
#
# GOAL: The robot hides an invisible ring on the floor. You drive with the
# gamepad and find it, using nothing but the lights the robot gives you.
# Drive into the ring and it stops and dances.
#
# You type the code yourself, from the guide. Thonny does the indenting.
#
# SAVE YOUR COPY FIRST: In Thonny, use File > Save As, pick the Alvik
# (MicroPython device), and save this file as /workspace/p06.py. From
# now on, open and edit THAT copy -- files outside /workspace get
# overwritten whenever the projects are updated.
#
# FLEX (the A+): there is one. The guide tells you what it is.
