# NHS Robotics — Decision Log

Numbers are permanent. A reversal is struck with its reason, not deleted.

Current state is in [PROJECT.md](PROJECT.md); durable knowledge is in
[REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md).

Entries 1-6 were written in `nhsrobotics/DECISIONS.md` on 2026-08-05 and are
carried here verbatim; that copy is now superseded and points here. Unless
noted, a decision affects both repos.

1. **Sumo (Capstone 1 tournament) is numbered P09, not P07.** — 2026-08-05

2. ~~**P07 is the line-alignment project**: drive until a line sensor sees the
   line, then square up on it regardless of approach angle (angle assumed
   acute). It introduces the line sensors, which P09 Sumo Skills previously
   did as a side effect of its edge guard.~~ — 2026-08-05
   — **2026-08-07: reversed by #10.** Line alignment is P08. P07 is the timer
   project. The reasoning above still holds for the project itself, only the
   number changed.

3. **Fall Term 1 is 22 periods (8/28-10/30); Term 2 is 21 (11/3-1/14).** Read
   from Ray's own calendar (`Red Blue 2627 Calendar.xlsx`, column G) and
   confirmed by him. — 2026-08-05

4. **Term 1's last period is not slack.** Students start P10 on 10/30 and
   finish it in Term 2 — the term boundary is a grading boundary, not a work
   boundary. — 2026-08-05
   — **2026-08-07: the calendar does not say this.** Column G's 10/30 cell
   reads only "End of Term 1"; P10 appears nowhere in the sheet. 10/30 is a
   real class day with no project assigned. The principle may still be Ray's
   intent, but it is not recorded anywhere and P10 is deferred to October.

5. **Cross-course date collisions are not treated as scheduling conflicts.**
   Ray's ruling: "we are not a one-room schoolhouse." A Robotics due date
   landing on a Physics exam day is not a problem to solve. — 2026-08-05

6. **The class's SWBAT for the state-machine unit is the `elif` tree keyed on
   a state variable** — not "state machines" as a general topic, and not any
   specific theme. Whatever project teaches it, a new state must be forced by
   real ambiguity or by a memoryless bug, never added to pad the count.
   — 2026-08-05

7. **Sumo (P09) is autonomous only. No gamepads.** Four robots start back to
   back, each runs a hunting pattern, and a robot charges when it detects
   another robot directly in front of it. Hitting the ring edge is a
   manoeuvre — back up, turn, resume hunting — not a veto on a human driver.
   The hunting pattern is where student individuality lives now that driver
   skill is gone. — 2026-08-07

8. **P09 is no longer designated Capstone 1.** It is a normal project, which
   means it may teach new material rather than only combining earlier work.
   — 2026-08-07

9. **Opponent detection is a 3 cm charge threshold. The five ToF zones are not
   taught.** The white floor produces IR false positives in the horizontal
   zones; rather than filtering them, the robot only believes readings close
   enough that an opponent is essentially touching it. Charge means shove from
   near-contact, so matches turn on the quality of the hunt pattern rather than
   on sensing range. — 2026-08-07

10. **The sequence through the designed portion of the course is P07 timers,
    P08 line sensor, P09 sumo.** This reverses #2 — line alignment moves from
    P07 to P08. P07 becomes the old P09 "Robot Timers" material; P07 and P09
    swap numbers in the repo. — 2026-08-07

11. **P07 is a driveable proximity alarm, built from the old Robot Timers
    material.** WORK 1 read the distance sensor and show it on the OLED while
    holding the robot in your hand. WORK 2 add a blink that speeds up as the
    distance closes. WORK 3 add tank drive, so display, blink and driving all
    run at once. FLEX: refuse positive motor speeds inside 5 cm, reverse always
    allowed. The split is deliberately additive — nothing rewrites an earlier
    WORK, so the one-checkpoint rule needs no exception. — 2026-08-07

12. **P07 has exactly one timer.** There is no display-refresh clock; the OLED
    is written every lap. `ticks_ms` appears in WORK 2, at the moment the
    student would otherwise reach for `sleep()` and discover it freezes the
    display they just built. Two independent clocks in one loop was considered
    and rejected as too much at once. — 2026-08-07

13. **P07 blinks both Alvik LEDs together via `sb.light_both_leds()`**, the
    helper P02 teaches and P04 uses. Individual `left_led` / `right_led` calls
    are for cases where the two differ, as in P06. The guide is built around
    the callback: P02 gave students a `blink()` that works by freezing the
    robot, and P07 is the same blink on the same lights, made not to freeze.
    — 2026-08-07

14. **The state machine is introduced at P08 and scaled at P09.** P08's
    alignment cannot be written as three sequential `while` loops: each is a
    blocking wait, and the sequence branches on which sensor trips first
    because the approach angle is arbitrary. So P08 gets one loop with a state
    variable on a job that ends. P09 reuses the shape for hunt, charge and
    edge recovery on a loop that never ends, and adds timed states — "how long
    have I been in this state" — as its one new idea. — 2026-08-07

15. **Every robot has an OLED, set up by students on the first day. Projects
    may assume it.** — 2026-08-07

16. **No controller rumble.** It exists nowhere in the codebase and would need
    robot-side and browser-side work plus a regression test. The Qwiic buzzer
    already in `peripherals.py` covers the same non-visual cue and needs only
    an `sb.` passthrough. — 2026-08-07

17. **Design work stops at P09.** P10 through P14 are decided in October, after
    Ray has run the class. No P10+ project may be used as an argument about
    P07-P09, because those slots may be rewritten or cut. — 2026-08-07

18. **P07 has two timer checks, not one. This reverses #12.** WORK 1 is a
    seconds clock on the OLED — divide elapsed milliseconds by 1000 and write
    the screen only when the whole number changes. WORK 2 adds the blink
    interval. The two arrive one WORK apart rather than together, which is what
    #12 rejected. The `sleep()` reasoning under #12 is also withdrawn: the
    course never offers `sleep()` as the timing tool, and P02's freezing
    `blink()` already supplied the pain. — 2026-08-09

19. **P07 is named "The Parking Sensor."** — 2026-08-09

20. **A P08 state machine alternates orders and watchers**, and every order is
    given exactly once by a state that exists to give it. `START_DRIVE` then
    `WATCH_DRIVE`, and so on. Re-issuing `drive()` on every pass floods the link
    to the STM32 and the robot stops seeing the line. A STOP state is required
    after first contact: brake, then watch the pose until it stops changing.
    Never assume a command has taken effect — the base is about 0.2 s behind.
    Affects `nhsrobotics` solutions. — 2026-08-09

21. **`LINE_THRESHOLD = 200`**, measured on marker over white paper: white reads
    about 50, a sensor on the line reads 300-650. During rotation all three
    sensors swing between 50 and 350, so while turning the robot looks at *only*
    the sensor it is waiting for. — 2026-08-09

22. **Solutions get a regression testbench, and it is for us, not students.**
    `nhsrobotics/tests/tb/` models the robot's world — pose, line, sensors — and
    shadows `arduino_alvik`, `nhs_robotics` and `time` on `sys.path` so the real
    solution files run unmodified. The DUT's own `sleep_ms` drives a simulated
    clock, so the suite finishes in under a second with no robot. Checks compute
    expectations from the world model, never from the solution's own arithmetic.
    The measured hardware defects are knobs, so an immunity claim can be a test
    rather than a comment. Run with `tests/run_solution_regression.py`; it is
    also folded into `tests/run_host_regression.py`. No pytest — Ray's call.
    Affects `nhsrobotics`. — 2026-08-09

23. **Scaffold `GIVEN:` comments say why the line is there, not just that it is
    given.** Applied across P01-P06 on 2026-08-09. Comments only; no code
    changed, so the approved guides still match. Affects `nhsrobotics`.
    — 2026-08-09

24. **`int(a / b)`, never `a // b`.** Floor division is a second operator to
    explain for no gain; `int()` is a function, and functions are a shape
    students already own from P02. Affects guides and code. — 2026-08-09

25. **Projects P08 and up were moved out of the active folders.**
    `projects/old_projects/` and `solutions/old_solutions/` hold P08-P14, moved
    with `git mv`. `projects/` and `solutions/` are P01-P07 only, so a deploy
    cannot push a stale numbered file. Affects `nhsrobotics`. — 2026-08-09

26. **Line alignment leaves Term 1 and becomes a Term 2 project.** It works on
    hardware — the version that stops on the CENTRE sensor and sweeps its arc
    aligns well from any oblique approach — but the guide would have to teach
    the arc-and-mirror argument to justify halving the angle, and that is a
    geometry lesson wearing a state machine's coat. Term 2 can carry it. The
    solution is parked at `solutions/sol1x_line_alignment.py`; its nine
    testbench checks are written for a later design than that file and skip on
    purpose. Affects both repos. — 2026-08-09

27. **A state may not turn away from the thing its own exit test measures.**
    P08 was first written as a Guard Bot with hysteresis: alarmed inside 20 cm,
    calm past 35, and the gap between them forcing the state variable. The
    alert state spun in place, which swung the distance sensor off the intruder
    and read 999 — past the calm threshold — so the alert ended in a few
    degrees and the two thresholds never did anything. The lesson generalises:
    if a state's exit depends on a reading, the state's actions must keep that
    reading meaningful. — 2026-08-09

28. **P08 is The Security Bot.** Patrol on green, advance slowly on anything
    inside 60 cm, and then one of two things: it fled past 90 cm, or it never
    moved and is now inside 15 cm, in which case turn 135 degrees and run.
    "It did not flee" is a fact about a stretch of time, not about a reading,
    which is the honest argument for a state variable. The retreat uses
    blocking `move()` and `rotate()` — the opposite of P07's rule, for the
    opposite reason: nothing needs watching while you leave. 135 and not 180 so
    the robot does not retrace its own path and bounce between two walls.
    Affects both repos. — 2026-08-09

29. **P09's guide prints code from earlier projects, not the lines to type.**
    Every other guide prints what to write. This one shows the student what
    they wrote in P03, P04, P06 and P08 to solve the same problem, and asks
    what has to change. "Capstone" here describes that method only; DECISIONS
    #8 stands and P09 is not designated Capstone 1. Affects `Class Development`.
    — 2026-08-09

30. **P09's one new idea is a guard above the elif tree, and it has no timer.**
    The edge test cannot live inside a branch — a robot must leave the rim
    whether it was patrolling or charging — so it sits above the tree and takes
    effect on the same pass, which is exactly what P08 taught transitions do
    not do. That contrast is the lesson. The consequence: the screen write must
    sit BELOW the guard, or a state the guard sets and the tree clears on one
    pass is never displayed. This also retires the timed-state half of
    DECISIONS #14 — the retreat blocks, the countdown is a human voice, and the
    gamepad wait is given, so there is nowhere for a clock. Affects both repos.
    — 2026-08-09

31. **The solution testbench models targets and rings, and every check is
    mutation-tested.** `tests/tb/plant.py` V02 adds a `Target` (stand, flee,
    chase, or glued to the nose, visible only in a 30 degree cone) and a ring
    (black inside, white rim, radius and width). A check is only trusted once
    the code has been broken on purpose and the check has failed: deleting
    P09's guard sends the robot 4.8 m from the ring centre and is caught;
    inverting P08's `distance < SPOT_CM` is caught by the empty-room test and
    NOT by the reaches-every-state or ordering checks. Affects `nhsrobotics`.
    — 2026-08-09

32. **Absent hardware is news, not a fault.** `RobotVision` reported a missing
    HuskyLens with `log_error` on every boot of every robot, and almost no
    robot has one. Downgraded to `log_info`, and the three per-attempt search
    prints dropped. A suite or a robot that cries wolf teaches everybody to
    skim past the word ERROR. Covered by a test that patches `QwiicHuskylens`
    rather than poking I2C, so it runs the same on a laptop and on a robot.
    Affects `nhsrobotics`. — 2026-08-09

33. **The deploy never ships the laptop's droppings.** `initialize_robot.sh`
    v30 strips `__pycache__`, `.DS_Store` and stray `.pyc` from the staging
    copy, and deletes them from the robot BEFORE the whitelist check. The order
    matters: a `.robotignore` entry means "leave this alone", so naming junk
    there preserves it instead of removing it. `.robotignore` is read from the
    folder passed to `-d`, not from `init_bot/`. Affects `nhsrobotics`.
    — 2026-08-09

34. **`PROJECT.md`, `DECISIONS.md` and `REFERENCE.md` live in the class's own
    repo, never in `Class Development`.** Moved into `nhsrobotics` on
    2026-08-09. `Class Development` holds Physics and Engineering as well as
    Robotics, and each class needs its own threads and its own history; one set
    of project files at the top of a shared folder would mix them, and a thread
    about one course would open by reading the state of another. Affects
    `nhsrobotics` and any future class repo. — 2026-08-09
