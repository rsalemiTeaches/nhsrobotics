# tests/tb/plant.py -- the reference model of the robot's world. V02
#
# The plant owns the truth: where the robot really is, where the line
# really is, what the sensors would really report. The DUT never sees any
# of it directly -- it sees only what the fake ArduinoAlvik hands back,
# which is the truth after the measured defects have been applied.
#
# The scoreboard checks against the plant's truth, never against the DUT's
# own numbers. A checker that recomputes the DUT's arithmetic is a mirror
# and passes whenever the DUT is wrong in an interesting way.
#
# GEOMETRY CAVEAT: the sensor placement below is a MODEL, not a
# measurement. Nobody has put calipers on an Alvik for these numbers. The
# alignment results are therefore correct up to this geometry -- which is
# fine, because P08's claim is that halving cancels a scale error, and
# that claim does not depend on the exact spacing. Measure and update if a
# test ever turns on the absolute numbers.
